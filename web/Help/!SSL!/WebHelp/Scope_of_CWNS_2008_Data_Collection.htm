<h1 class="whs1">Scope of CWNS 2008 Data Collection</h1>

<p class="whs2">CWNS 2008 includes needs 
 and relevant technical information (flow, population, discharge, effluent, 
 unit process, and utility management data) for publicly owned municipal 
 wastewater collection and treatment, CSO correction, municipal storm water 
 management, NPS pollution control, and recycled water distribution. &nbsp;To 
 meet some of the goals and objectives set by EPA and the States, several 
 changes will be implemented in 2008, including:</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• The definition of needs 
 is expanded to include 20-year needs estimates. &nbsp;For 
 2008, EPA defines a need as a project, with associated costs, that addresses 
 a water quality or public health problem existing as of January 1, 2008 
 or expected to occur within the next 20 years (by December 31, 2027). 
 &nbsp;Emphasizing 
 20-year needs encourages advanced asset management and EPA’s Sustainable 
 Infrastructure Initiative.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• CWSRF eligibility is no 
 longer a requirement for CWNS eligibility. &nbsp;States 
 may enter needs for facilities and projects that are not CWSRF eligible, 
 as long as they meet the CWNS eligibility and documentation criteria outlined 
 in Chapter 2. &nbsp;States 
 will then identify and certify the portion of each need that is CWSRF 
 eligible, according to national CWSRF eligibility rules. </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• Several needs categories 
 are changed or refined. &nbsp;Decentralized 
 Wastewater Management Needs (formally Category VII-L) is its own category 
 (Category XII). &nbsp;Stormwater 
 Management Program Needs (Category VI) has four new subcategories and 
 includes needs in unregulated communities (formerly captured in Category 
 VII-D: NPS Urban). &nbsp;Estuary 
 Management is included in the NPS Needs categories as Category VII-M (formerly 
 XI). &nbsp;Category 
 XIII: Planning is added to collect the needs and costs for planning, such 
 as developing watershed-based plans and source water protection plans. 
 &nbsp;Details 
 on the CWNS 2008 needs categories are outlined in Chapter 2 and Appendix 
 B.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• A new Web-based data entry 
 portal (DEP) is implemented to make data entry easier. It integrates with 
 other EPA data systems (Chapter 4), allows electronic document submittal 
 (Chapter 9), and provides enhanced cost curves (Chapter 9). &nbsp;It 
 allows local users to submit CWNS data to their States electronically 
 and multiple State users (e.g. stormwater personnel entering stormwater 
 needs) to submit data (Chapter 15).</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• The scope of eligible 
 nonpoint source (NPS) pollution control projects now includes both needs 
 addressing impaired waters and NPS prevention activities for all waters.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• In addition to Unit Process 
 data, Utility Management data is being collected. &nbsp;This 
 supports EPA’s SI initiative by helping to assess the degree of adoption 
 and implementation of various voluntary utility management programs by 
 facilities and collecting more current and complete treatment technology 
 data.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• EPA is providing outreach 
 tools to assist States to more accurately report of traditionally underreported 
 needs categories, including Decentralized Wastewater Treatment, Stormwater 
 Management, NPS Pollution Prevention, and Small Community Needs (Chapter 
 3). </p>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;</p>
