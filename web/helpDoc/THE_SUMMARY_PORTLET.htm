<h3><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "><font size=4 style="font-size:14pt;">THE SUMMARY PORTLET</font></span></h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img width="249" height="464" src="cwnsusersguide_files/image003.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="BodyText">This portlet shows what data are
present or required, and provides access to all other applicable data pages.
Furthermore, this portlet will indicate where Cost
Curve errors or review errors exist for the facility.</p>

<p class="BodyText">The Summary portlet displays:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">Hyperlinks showing the various Data Areas
applicable to the currently selected facility (e.g., “Facility Information,”
“Population,” Combined Sewer,” “Flow,” etc.).</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">Check boxes indicating whether the available
Data Areas have fields that are mandatory (“Req”),
have data already entered (“Ent”), and/or have any
associated errors (“Err”).</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">A check box (“Cor”)
showing which Data Area(s) caused the facility to be rejected by EPA Survey
Quality Assurance (SQA) personnel, if the facility has already been reviewed.</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">A “Show Only Curve Errors” check box, used to
identify only the errors associated with cost curves.</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">A hyperlink that will launch a window containing
all Comments pertaining to the facility, written by the State user(s).</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">A hyperlink that will launch a window containing
the all the facilities that are part of the current facility’s sewershed (see Chapter 5 - Technical Data).</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">The name of the most recent SQA User to assign a
Review Code to the facility.</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">The name of the most recent State User to make a
change to a facility.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="BodyText">Selecting the Data Area hyperlink on the Summary portlet will bring up the associated data page (e.g.,
selecting the “Population” hyperlink, or the Flow hyperlink, will display the
Population &amp; Flow page). The individual data windows are explained in more
detail in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p class="BodyText">&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How to Use the Summary portlet</h4>

<p class="BodyText">The Summary portlet is designed
to help you edit and update facility information easily and quickly. The portlet contains a series of hyperlinks and check boxes
relating to each data area in the CWNS database. For each data area, the check
boxes on this window display:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">whether data are required (mandatory);</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">whether data are entered; and/or</p>

</li>
 <li>
 <p class="InlineBodyText2">whether there are any
data errors associated with that window.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText">Consequently, by referring to this portlet,
you can tell at a glance which data areas you need to edit and/or update to
prepare the facility to be assigned a Review Status of “Federal Review
Requested” and be submitted to EPA HQ for inclusion in the CWNS RtC.</p>

<p class="BodyText">If data for a given area are indicated as required (the “Req” box is checked) but no data are entered (the “Ent” box is unchecked), then you know that you need to go
to that page and add data.</p>

<p class="BodyText">Also, if errors are indicated for a data area (the “Err”
box is checked), then you know to go to the applicable pages to correct the
error(s). Any error messages should be displayed when you first enter the page
concerned. You may use these automated error messages to help you decide which
data need to be corrected.</p>

<p class="BodyText">Checking the “Show Only Cost Curve Errors” check box will
cause the “Err” check boxes on the Summary portlet to
ONLY show errors that are associated with CWNS cost curves. This should allow
you to quickly solve problems involved with running these cost curves owing to
database data errors.</p>

<p class="BodyText">Additionally, if Survey QA (SQA) Personnel have reviewed
and rejected one or more of your facilities, they will assign them with a Review
Code of “State Correction Requested” and some facility data may need to be
edited before you resubmit the facility for review. When the “State Correction
Requested” status is assigned, SQA will also check the “Cor”
check box on the Summary portlet to indicate the data
area that needs correction, and a Review Comment from the reviewer will be
included. </p>

<p class="BodyText">As you can see from the above, using the Summary portlet as your starting point for data entry can be very
helpful.</p>

<p class="BodyText">Note that, although the check boxes show what minimum data
are required for the facility to be submitted for Federal review, the Summary portlet will not tell you which technical and needs data
must be updated because they are out of date. Consequently, you should check
your other data to ensure that they are current.</p>
