<h1 class="whs1">User Roles and Access Levels</h1>

<p class="whs2">Users can and, in many cases 
 need to, have more than one access level. In addition, users can be granted 
 access to all facilities/projects in the State, or they can be restricted 
 to one or more facilities/projects</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Example A: &nbsp;A 
 wastewater treatment plant operator wants to enter needs and technical 
 information about his facility. &nbsp;The 
 State User Manager gives him the role Local. &nbsp;He 
 needs two access levels- Facility Update-Feedback and Submit for State 
 Review- in order to be able to access, provide feedback on a facility/project, 
 and return the feedback to the State User. &nbsp;The 
 State User Manager restricts the Local User to just his facility.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Example B: The State User 
 Manager has sufficient information from a CWSRF loan application to update 
 the needs and technical data for a large wastewater facility in the State. 
 &nbsp;Due to 
 the size of the facility, Unit Process data is required and the State 
 does not have that information. &nbsp;The 
 State User Manager grants a member of facility’s staff the role of Local 
 User with Facility Update- Partial access level for the facility. &nbsp;The 
 Local User can view all the data and can directly update the Unit Process 
 data for the facility.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Example C: &nbsp;The 
 State CWNS Coordinator and the State Stormwater Coordinator are working 
 work together to ensure that Stormwater needs are well documented. &nbsp;The 
 State User Manager can assign the State Stormwater Coordinator either 
 a State role or Local role. </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Option C-1: The State Stormwater 
 Coordinator is given a State role and the Facility Update access level. 
 &nbsp;The State 
 Stormwater Coordinator can add, update, and delete data directly in the 
 DEP. &nbsp;The 
 system does not track which data has been changed. &nbsp;A 
 State User with Submit for Federal Review access level can review the 
 data before submitting it for Federal Review. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Option C-2: The State Stormwater 
 Coordinator is given a State role and the Facility Update and Submit for 
 Federal Review access levels for specific facilities/projects. &nbsp;The 
 State Stormwater Coordinator can add, update, and delete data for assigned 
 facilities/projects directly in the DEP. &nbsp;The 
 system does not track which data has been changed. &nbsp;The 
 State Stormwater Coordinator can submit data for Federal Review for the 
 assigned facilities/projects. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Option C-3: &nbsp;The 
 State Stormwater Coordinator is given a Local role and Facility Update-Feedback 
 and Submit for State Review access levels. &nbsp;The 
 State Stormwater Coordinator is given access to a feedback copy for each 
 facility/project. &nbsp;He/she 
 can add, update, and delete data in the feedback copy. &nbsp;When 
 finished, the State Stormwater Coordinator submits the feedback copy for 
 State review. &nbsp;The 
 State can compare the original data with the feedback data and decide 
 which changes to make. After making the appropriate changes based the 
 feedback and reviewing the data, a State User with Facility Update and 
 Submit for Federal Review access level can review the data before submitting 
 it for Federal Review. &nbsp;</p>
