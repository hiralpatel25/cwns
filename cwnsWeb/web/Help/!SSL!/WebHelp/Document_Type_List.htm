<h1 class="whs1">Document Type List</h1>

<p class="whs2">The documents are grouped, based on the need 
 type that they are most commonly used to support, into the following five 
 sections: (1) Documents with no specific emphasis; (2) wastewater treatment; 
 (3) non-point source (NPS); (4) stormwater; and (5) small communities. 
 &nbsp;The grouping 
 is to ease the documentation process and is not meant to limit which types 
 of documents can be used for which type of need. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">The document descriptions include:</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• Document Name</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• Updated CWNS 2008 document 
 number in parenthesis (#)</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• Legacy (CWNS 2004) document 
 numbers in brackets [#]</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• An indication of whether 
 or not the document can be used to justify needs (demonstrate a water-quality 
 or water related public health problem) and/or costs. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• An indication of whether 
 or not the document type is footnotable. Footnotable documents do not 
 need to be sent to EPA for review and are retained in the state’s files. 
 &nbsp;To be footnotable, 
 the document type must (1) say “yes” next to Footnotable and (2) be for 
 a facility/project that has total needs of less than $20 million (2008 
 dollars). </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• The percentage of the 
 needs that were justified with the document type in 2004.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">• A description of the document

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">The Intended Use Plan (IUP), which is prepared 
 annually, uses state-assigned criteria to rank projects for which federal 
 funding assistance is being sought during the current federal fiscal year. 
 The primary purpose of the IUP is to identify proposed annual intended 
 uses of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) money. A section 
 212 project listed in the IUP must be on the State Priority List to be 
 eligible for CWSRF funding. &nbsp;A 
 section 319 or 320 activity is not required to be on the State Priority 
 List unless the activity is considered to be “nontraditional” NPS pursuant 
 to the Funding Framework. However, such activities must be listed on a 
 state’s IUP for funding to occur. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">For CWNS, some states need to consider only 
 their most recent IUP, because their states roll unfunded projects from 
 previous IUPs forward to the most current IUP. Other states need to consider 
 several IUPs, because unfunded projects are not rolled forward but are 
 still considered active. States may use any IUP that EPA has accepted 
 since the close of data collection for the previous CWNS Report to Congress 
 (February 18, 2005 for CWNS 2008) to document need and cost (with the 
 exception of project refinancing or set-asides) if the need still exists 
 as of January 1, 2008 and the information is current. States must contact 
 EPA before using IUPs accepted by EPA before February 18, 2005, and they 
 will be considered on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp;For 
 states that voluntarily use an Integrated Planning and Priority Setting 
 System (IPPS), only the portion of the document that presents the separate 
 IUP exhibit should be considered an IUP for purposes of the CWNS. If the 
 full scope of the project is to be funded over several years, the total 
 amount should be entered for costs. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">This estimate of cost must be based on at least 
 three projects that:</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Were bid or completed 
 within the last two years </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

 size of the project (e.g., population served, pipe lengths, flow treated) 
 must be within plus or minus 25 percent of the size of the sample. Generally, 
 projects should be in the same county or watershed. &nbsp;In 
 some cases, it may be appropriate to use Document Type 05 to determine

 date of one of the documents used for the analysis. </p>

<p class="whs2">Depending on the Category of cost, certain 
 specific rules apply to the use of Document Type 05. The specific rules 
 are presented below:</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Categories I and II: The 
 flow treated should be within plus or minus 25 percent of the size of 
 the sample.</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Categories III and IV 
 needs documented with pipe lengths/replacement rates: &nbsp;For 
 each combination of pipe type/grade, a comparative cost estimate must 
 have well documented costs per unit length for each type/grade combination 
 used in the sample. For these categories the soil conditions of the project 
 must be approximately the same as those for the sample</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Category V: Document Type 
 05 cannot be used to justify category V needs.</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Category VI: The size 
 of the Best Management Practices (BMPs) must be within plus or minus 25 
 percent of the size of the sample.</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Category VII: Extrapolating 
 will be permitted for estimating BMPs in reasonably analogous watersheds 
 (e.g., similar land use, weather patterns, and/or hydrology) and in areas 
 with a reasonably analogous pollution sources (e.g., grazing, abandoned 
 mine drainage) requiring the same BMPs. Proportional extrapolations of 
 costs (i.e., if the cost to implement a program in a 10,000 acres watershed 
 is $1,000,000 then the cost in a 20,000 acres watershed must be $2,000,000) 
 are only acceptable if they are for the implementation of a specific solution 
 that is directly related to areas, for example acquisition of easements, 
 conservation tillage, nutrient management on agriculture fields, or riparian 
 buffers.</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Category X: The flow treated 
 should be within plus or minus 25 percent of the size of the sample.</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Category XII: &nbsp;Same 
 rules as Category VII apply.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Clean Water Act section 208 and 303(e) Regional 
 Basin Plans are broad-based water quality management plans written primarily 
 to identify future planning for areas within a state. These reports study 
 large areas such as basins or counties and usually recommend general solutions 
 to current or anticipated wastewater needs within the planning area. Only 
 section 208 and 303(e) documents that contain site-specific information 
 and a description of a need may be accepted as documentation of need. 
 Documentation of cost is assessed on a case-by-case basis depending on 
 the amount of detail reported and the source of the information. </p>

<p class="whs2">A TMDL is an estimation of the maximum amount 
 of a pollutant that an impaired waterbody (listed on a state’s 303(d) 
 list) can receive and still meet water quality standards. It includes 
 an allocation of the allowable pollutant discharge amount from different 
 point and NPS. Project-specific needs should be identified. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">TMDL Reports or TMDL Implementation Plans containing 
 cost data will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp;Costs 
 reported in TMDL implementation plans are usually estimated by (1) identifying/quantifying 
 the corrective actions that are needed; (2) researching the unit costs; 
 and (3) multiplying the unit cost by the number of units required. &nbsp;Only 
 costs reported in the TMDL implementation plans should be assigned to 
 this document type. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">A Comprehensive Conservation and Management 
 Plan (CCMP) is a management plan developed for an estuary that has been 
 nominated for the CWA section 320 National Estuary Program (NEP). The 
 CCMP summarizes findings, determines environmental quality goals and objectives, 
 identifies and establishes priorities for addressing problems, identifies 
 action plans and compliance schedules for pollution control and resource 
 management, and ensures that designated uses of the estuary are protected. 
 </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">CCMPs are developed by the twenty-eight estuaries 
 (in eighteen states and Puerto Rico) in the NEP. &nbsp;All 
 28 CCMPS have been completed and approved by EPA; some NEPs are revisiting 
 and updating their CCMPs. They vary in format and detail and can be used 
 by states to document needs, particularly non-point source needs. Some 
 of the CCMPs are posted at: http://www.epa.gov/owow/estuaries/list.htm</p>

<p class="whs2">Need: Yes Cost: No Footnoteable: No</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">Clean Water Act Section 304(a) directs EPA 
 to develop scientific information on pollutants and to publish “criteria 
 guidance.” &nbsp;The 
 criteria guidance, often expressed as pollutant concentration levels, 
 will result in attainment of the state’s designated use for the waterbody 
 (e.g. fishing, swimming). &nbsp;These 
 concentration levels generally are the same for all types of waterbodies 
 nationwide. &nbsp;States 
 consider these EPA “criteria guidance” when they adopt water quality standards 
 for waterbodies. A water quality standard commonly includes a designated 
 use for the waterbody and criteria (i.e. concentration levels) for a range 
 of pollutants that will assure that the waterbody will support the designated 
 use. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">In the case of nutrients, however, there is 
 a great deal of variability in inherent nutrient levels and nutrient responses 
 throughout the country. This natural variability is due to differences 
 in geology, climate, and waterbody type. Because of this variation, EPA's 
 custom of developing scientific information about a pollutant and recommending 
 a single pollutant concentration number to support a designated use for 
 nationwide application is not appropriate for nutrients. EPA believes 
 that distinct geographic regions and types of waterbodies need to be evaluated 
 differently and that recommended nutrient concentration levels need to 
 reflect geographic variation and waterbody types.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">EPA requires states develop nutrient criteria 
 plans for incorporation into their water quality standards development 
 efforts. &nbsp;In 
 many cases, these studies contain description of water quality problems 
 that can be used to justify a need. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">A CIP, sometimes referred to as a Master Plan, 
 is a fiscal planning document used by local governments (e.g., authorities, 
 cities, counties, districts) designed to anticipate capital improvement 
 projects or equipment and schedule them over a period of time. &nbsp;The 
 planning period of CIPs can span from 1 to 20 years. Most CIPs contain 
 project- and cost-specific information.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">A CIP is an acceptable form of documentation 
 to justify a need and the appropriate project-specific costs. However, 
 they can only be used to justify a need if the document addresses why 
 the project is needed. When using CIPs to justify needs, keep the following 
 items in mind:</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Inclusion in a CIP is 
 not by itself a justification for need. If the CIP does not contain a 
 satisfactory description of an existing problem, additional documentation 
 to support such need should be provided with associated costs in order 
 to justify need and cost.</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs7">• Some CIPs include projects 
 needed as a result of projected growth. Projected growth can only be used 
 to justify need when the existing treatment plant, collection system or 
 pollution control system cannot handle either the projected capacity or 
 meet the required treatment levels.</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">An I/I Analysis is a document that identifies 
 excessive flow problems due to infiltration or inflow into the sewerage. 
 The problems are usually identified by the use of television inspection 
 of the sewer, smoke testing, flow metering, or physical survey. The recommendations 
 section of the report should be checked to determine the recommended solution 
 to the problem. In some cases, the report might recommend a &quot;no action&quot; 
 alternative, because it is more cost-effective not to correct the excessive 
 I/I problem. In such cases, no costs would be reported from this document 
 but could still be reported from other documents. The I/I Analysis may 
 be contained within a Facility Plan, a Sewer System Evaluation Survey, 
 or a Combined Sewer Overflow Report; if that is the case, it should be 
 reported under these documents and not as Document Type 24.</p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">An SSES is a document that contains the results 
 of a sewer system survey, manhole inspection, smoke testing, and flow

 and identifies areas of combined sewers, downspout connections, and locations 
 where the sewer system is at capacity. Recommendations may include replacing 
 areas with larger-diameter pipe, grouting joints, and separating sewers 
 in areas of combined sewers. In many cases a combined ewer overflow (CSO) 
 study is placed in this category. &nbsp;This 
 is appropriate unless it is a CSO Long Term Control Plan (LTCP) which

<p class="whs2">A sanitary survey is a logical, investigative 
 approach to gather information to evaluate the condition of existing Onsite 
 Wastewater Treatment Systems (OWTS). These surveys are performed to document 
 the condition of existing OWTS for facility planning purposes and to locate 
 sources of water pollution and public health problems. </p>

<p class="whs2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs2">The sanitary survey must document high, areawide 
 failure rates that are considered serious enough to be a health hazard 
 (such as ground water contamination caused by malfunctioning OWTSs) in 
 order to document a need. The documentation must clearly state that OWTS 
 failures are contributing to a water pollution or health-related problem. 
 The fact that an area has soils unsuitable for OWTSs does not document 
 the need for sewers or a treatment plant. Communities with populations

<p class="whs2">A Wellhead Protection Plan may be used to document 
 NPS needs if it is part of a NPS Management Program. As part of at state’s 
 overall ground water protection strategy, each state must delineate wellhead 
 protection areas for wells or well fields used for public water supply. 
 Contaminant sources within the wellhead protection area must be identified 
 and a management plan developed to protect the water supply in that area 
 from contamination. Contingency plans for each public water supply system 
 must be developed to ensure an appropriate response in the event that 
 contamination occurs, and standards must be established for locating new 
 wells so as to minimize the potential for contamination of the water supply.

 Farm Plans and Conservation Plans are documents developed by NRCS (or 
 Conservation Districts) and farmers or landowner. They are a series of 
 actions developed to meet a farmer’s goals while protecting water quality 
 and the natural resources. Some of the things considered in a plan are 
 farm size, soils type, slope of the land, proximity to streams or water 
 bodies, type of livestock or crops, the farmer’s goals, resources such 
 as machinery or buildings and finances available. Farm Plans and Conservation 
 Plans recommend practices to improve farm productivity, reduce the impact 
 on the natural resources, and address potential water quality concerns.
