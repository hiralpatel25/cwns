<h1 style="font-size: 11pt;">Document Type List</h1>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">The documents are grouped, based on the need 
 type that they are most commonly used to support, into the following five 
 sections: (1) Documents with no specific emphasis; (2) wastewater treatment; 
 (3) non-point source (NPS); (4) stormwater; and (5) small communities. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The grouping 
 is to ease the documentation process and is not meant to limit which types 
 of documents can be used for which type of need. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">The document descriptions include:</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">• Document Name</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">• Updated CWNS 2008 document 
 number in parenthesis (#)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">• Legacy (CWNS 2004) document 
 numbers in brackets [#]</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">• An indication of whether 
 or not the document can be used to justify needs (demonstrate a water-quality 
 or water related public health problem) and/or costs. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--></p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">• An indication of whether 
 or not the document type is footnotable. Footnotable documents do not 
 need to be sent to EPA for review and are retained in the state’s files. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->To be footnotable, 
 the document type must (1) say “yes” next to Footnotable and (2) be for 
 a facility/project that has total needs of less than $20 million (2008 
 dollars). </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">• The percentage of the 
 needs that were justified with the document type in 2004.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">• A description of the document 
 type, which may include specific information for some needs categories.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 11pt;">• In some cases, suggestions 
 for related document types that may provide needs or costs justifications</p>

 11]</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Need: Yes Costs: Yes Footnoteable: Yes % 2004 
 needs: 4.7</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">The Intended Use Plan (IUP), which is prepared 
 annually, uses state-assigned criteria to rank projects for which federal 
 funding assistance is being sought during the current federal fiscal year. 
 The primary purpose of the IUP is to identify proposed annual intended 
 uses of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) money. A section 
 212 project listed in the IUP must be on the State Priority List to be 
 eligible for CWSRF funding. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->A 
 section 319 or 320 activity is not required to be on the State Priority 
 List unless the activity is considered to be “nontraditional” NPS pursuant 
 to the Funding Framework. However, such activities must be listed on a 
 state’s IUP for funding to occur. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">For CWNS, some states need to consider only 
 their most recent IUP, because their states roll unfunded projects from 
 previous IUPs forward to the most current IUP. Other states need to consider 
 several IUPs, because unfunded projects are not rolled forward but are 
 still considered active. States may use any IUP that EPA has accepted 
 since the close of data collection for the previous CWNS Report to Congress 
 (February 18, 2005 for CWNS 2008) to document need and cost (with the 
 exception of project refinancing or set-asides) if the need still exists 
 as of January 1, 2008 and the information is current. States must contact 
 EPA before using IUPs accepted by EPA before February 18, 2005, and they 
 will be considered on a case-by-case basis. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 states that voluntarily use an Integrated Planning and Priority Setting 
 System (IPPS), only the portion of the document that presents the separate 
 IUP exhibit should be considered an IUP for purposes of the CWNS. If the 
 full scope of the project is to be funded over several years, the total 
 amount should be entered for costs. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Federal or equivalent state grant applications 
 may be used to document needs and to update costs for the categories for 
 which the grant or loan money is requested. Applications should contain 
 a clearly written narrative that defines the specific project and the 
 water quality or public health problem. The application’s supporting documentation 
 must be submitted. Examples are EPA’s 319 Nonpoint Source Grants, Housing 
 and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant, and Rural 
 Utilities Service funding.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Loan and grant application forms are acceptable 
 for documenting need if the form and/or supporting materials contain the 
 following minimum elements: </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

 township, parish, or county.). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->A 
 local government official does not mean just the elected representative 
 (e.g., Mayor); it can be any other qualified official (e.g., public works 
 manager)</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Grant and loan applications are acceptable 
 for documenting cost if a cost estimate prepared and signed by an engineer 
 or engineer circuit rider is attached. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 cost estimate must include the engineer's rationale for the estimate; 
 it need not be as detailed as that found in a facility plan. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--></p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">If the grant or loan application package includes 
 a Final Engineer’s Estimate (23), Preliminary Engineer’s Estimate (22), 
 Facility Plan (21), or other of the pre-approved documents, the costs 
 should be entered under these other document categories and not as Document 
 Type 02.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">CWSRF applications may be used to document 
 needs and costs for the categories for which the loan money is requested. 
 Applications should contain a clearly written narrative that defines the 
 specific project and the water quality or public health problem. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: bold;">Non-governmental Grant Applications

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Grant applications written to non-governmental 
 organizations may be used to document needs and to update costs for the 
 categories for which the grant money is requested. The applicant can be 
 either a local government or a non-governmental organization. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Applications 
 should contain clearly written narrative that defines the specific project 
 and the water quality or public health problem. All supporting documentation 
 to the grant application must be submitted. Some examples are applications 
 to foundations and other non-governmental funders at the local, state 
 (e.g., Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay Trust), regional (e.g., Charles Stewart 
 Mott Foundation), and national level (e.g., National Fish and Wildlife 
 Foundation).</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

 needs: 3.0</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">This document type can be used to justify costs 
 but not needs. The approach used to create each document must be pre-approved 
 by EPA Region &amp; headquarters before entering the information into 
 the system. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--></p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">This estimate of cost must be based on at least 
 three projects that:</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Were bid or completed 
 within the last two years </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Are similar in size, scope, 
 and geographic area (e.g., county, watershed). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 size of the project (e.g., population served, pipe lengths, flow treated) 
 must be within plus or minus 25 percent of the size of the sample. Generally, 
 projects should be in the same county or watershed. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In 
 some cases, it may be appropriate to use Document Type 05 to determine 
 costs for larger geographic areas (e.g. region, state). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}--></p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

 detailed construction cost data are available. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">The document date entered in the system should 
 be the date when EPA headquarters approved the use of the document. The 
 base date should be the date the state judges to be the best fit for the 
 group of documents that are being used. Note: Some adjustments might be 
 needed during the Review Process. Ideally, the base date should be the 
 date of one of the documents used for the analysis. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Depending on the Category of cost, certain 
 specific rules apply to the use of Document Type 05. The specific rules 
 are presented below:</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Categories I and II: The 
 flow treated should be within plus or minus 25 percent of the size of 
 the sample.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Categories III and IV 
 needs documented with pipe lengths/replacement rates: <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->For 
 each combination of pipe type/grade, a comparative cost estimate must 
 have well documented costs per unit length for each type/grade combination 
 used in the sample. For these categories the soil conditions of the project 
 must be approximately the same as those for the sample</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Category V: Document Type 
 05 cannot be used to justify category V needs.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Category VI: The size 
 of the Best Management Practices (BMPs) must be within plus or minus 25 
 percent of the size of the sample.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Category VII: Extrapolating 
 will be permitted for estimating BMPs in reasonably analogous watersheds 
 (e.g., similar land use, weather patterns, and/or hydrology) and in areas 
 with a reasonably analogous pollution sources (e.g., grazing, abandoned 
 mine drainage) requiring the same BMPs. Proportional extrapolations of 
 costs (i.e., if the cost to implement a program in a 10,000 acres watershed 
 is $1,000,000 then the cost in a 20,000 acres watershed must be $2,000,000) 
 are only acceptable if they are for the implementation of a specific solution 
 that is directly related to areas, for example acquisition of easements, 
 conservation tillage, nutrient management on agriculture fields, or riparian 
 buffers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Category X: The flow treated 
 should be within plus or minus 25 percent of the size of the sample.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Category XII: <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Same 
 rules as Category VII apply.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Clean Water Act section 208 and 303(e) Regional 
 Basin Plans are broad-based water quality management plans written primarily 
 to identify future planning for areas within a state. These reports study 
 large areas such as basins or counties and usually recommend general solutions 
 to current or anticipated wastewater needs within the planning area. Only 
 section 208 and 303(e) documents that contain site-specific information 
 and a description of a need may be accepted as documentation of need. 
 Documentation of cost is assessed on a case-by-case basis depending on 
 the amount of detail reported and the source of the information. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">These plans are similar to State-Approved Area-wide 
 Basin Plans (06). These local plans also cover fairly large areas and 
 might not contain project-specific information. The plans must clearly 
 identify a water quality or health-related problem and must be project-specific 
 to be acceptable as documentation. </p>

 No % 2004 needs: &lt;0.1</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">A TMDL is an estimation of the maximum amount 
 of a pollutant that an impaired waterbody (listed on a state’s 303(d) 
 list) can receive and still meet water quality standards. It includes 
 an allocation of the allowable pollutant discharge amount from different 
 point and NPS. Project-specific needs should be identified. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">TMDL Reports or TMDL Implementation Plans containing 
 cost data will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Costs 
 reported in TMDL implementation plans are usually estimated by (1) identifying/quantifying 
 the corrective actions that are needed; (2) researching the unit costs; 
 and (3) multiplying the unit cost by the number of units required. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->Only 
 costs reported in the TMDL implementation plans should be assigned to 
 this document type. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">A good example of an implementation plan with 
 acceptable cost information is the Portneuf River</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">A Comprehensive Conservation and Management 
 Plan (CCMP) is a management plan developed for an estuary that has been 
 nominated for the CWA section 320 National Estuary Program (NEP). The 
 CCMP summarizes findings, determines environmental quality goals and objectives, 
 identifies and establishes priorities for addressing problems, identifies 
 action plans and compliance schedules for pollution control and resource 
 management, and ensures that designated uses of the estuary are protected. 
 </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">CCMPs are developed by the twenty-eight estuaries 
 (in eighteen states and Puerto Rico) in the NEP. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->All 
 28 CCMPS have been completed and approved by EPA; some NEPs are revisiting 
 and updating their CCMPs. They vary in format and detail and can be used 
 by states to document needs, particularly non-point source needs. Some 
 of the CCMPs are posted at: http://www.epa.gov/owow/estuaries/list.htm</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Clean Water Act Section 304(a) directs EPA 
 to develop scientific information on pollutants and to publish “criteria 
 guidance.” <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 criteria guidance, often expressed as pollutant concentration levels, 
 will result in attainment of the state’s designated use for the waterbody 
 (e.g. fishing, swimming). <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->These 
 concentration levels generally are the same for all types of waterbodies 
 nationwide. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->States 
 consider these EPA “criteria guidance” when they adopt water quality standards 
 for waterbodies. A water quality standard commonly includes a designated 
 use for the waterbody and criteria (i.e. concentration levels) for a range 
 of pollutants that will assure that the waterbody will support the designated 
 use. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">In the case of nutrients, however, there is 
 a great deal of variability in inherent nutrient levels and nutrient responses 
 throughout the country. This natural variability is due to differences 
 in geology, climate, and waterbody type. Because of this variation, EPA's 
 custom of developing scientific information about a pollutant and recommending 
 a single pollutant concentration number to support a designated use for 
 nationwide application is not appropriate for nutrients. EPA believes 
 that distinct geographic regions and types of waterbodies need to be evaluated 
 differently and that recommended nutrient concentration levels need to 
 reflect geographic variation and waterbody types.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">EPA requires states develop nutrient criteria 
 plans for incorporation into their water quality standards development 
 efforts. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->In 
 many cases, these studies contain description of water quality problems

 discharging into impaired waters can justify their needs if the projects 
 specifically address the pollutant causing the impairment. Within the

 the database of impaired waters based on the discharge location (i.e., 
 receiving water). There will be no need to submit documentation; a valid

 needs: 37.3</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">A CIP, sometimes referred to as a Master Plan, 
 is a fiscal planning document used by local governments (e.g., authorities, 
 cities, counties, districts) designed to anticipate capital improvement 
 projects or equipment and schedule them over a period of time. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->The 
 planning period of CIPs can span from 1 to 20 years. Most CIPs contain 
 project- and cost-specific information.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">A CIP is an acceptable form of documentation 
 to justify a need and the appropriate project-specific costs. However, 
 they can only be used to justify a need if the document addresses why 
 the project is needed. When using CIPs to justify needs, keep the following 
 items in mind:</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Inclusion in a CIP is 
 not by itself a justification for need. If the CIP does not contain a 
 satisfactory description of an existing problem, additional documentation 
 to support such need should be provided with associated costs in order 
 to justify need and cost.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• Some CIPs include projects 
 needed as a result of projected growth. Projected growth can only be used 
 to justify need when the existing treatment plant, collection system or 
 pollution control system cannot handle either the projected capacity or 
 meet the required treatment levels.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt; margin-left: 40px;">• CIPs frequently describe 
 areawide projects with little specific detail, which makes the assignment 
 of the correct needs category difficult.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Only information covering the recommended alternative

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Preliminary Engineer's Estimate is a preliminary 
 engineering study to assess the scope and feasibility of the project before 
 more detailed planning occurs. This documentation type encompasses documents 
 ranging from a memo to a formal Engineer's Preliminary Estimate or Engineer's 
 Preliminary Study. As long as the need is project-specific and the document 
 identifies a current problem, the document is acceptable. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">The Preliminary Engineer's Estimate document

 (I/I) Analysis and Sewer System Evaluation Survey (SSES).</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">An I/I Analysis is a document that identifies 
 excessive flow problems due to infiltration or inflow into the sewerage. 
 The problems are usually identified by the use of television inspection 
 of the sewer, smoke testing, flow metering, or physical survey. The recommendations 
 section of the report should be checked to determine the recommended solution 
 to the problem. In some cases, the report might recommend a &quot;no action&quot; 
 alternative, because it is more cost-effective not to correct the excessive 
 I/I problem. In such cases, no costs would be reported from this document 
 but could still be reported from other documents. The I/I Analysis may 
 be contained within a Facility Plan, a Sewer System Evaluation Survey, 
 or a Combined Sewer Overflow Report; if that is the case, it should be 
 reported under these documents and not as Document Type 24.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">An SSES is a document that contains the results 
 of a sewer system survey, manhole inspection, smoke testing, and flow 
 monitoring. It is used to evaluate the physical condition of a sewer system 
 and identifies areas of combined sewers, downspout connections, and locations 
 where the sewer system is at capacity. Recommendations may include replacing 
 areas with larger-diameter pipe, grouting joints, and separating sewers 
 in areas of combined sewers. In many cases a combined ewer overflow (CSO) 
 study is placed in this category. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->This

 it experiences design, operational, analytical, or financial problems 
 that limit the performance of the facility. This type of evaluation may 
 be used to document a need if the results indicate that construction is 
 necessary to achieve compliance. Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) related 
 problems do not document a need. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">A sanitary survey is a logical, investigative 
 approach to gather information to evaluate the condition of existing Onsite 
 Wastewater Treatment Systems (OWTS). These surveys are performed to document 
 the condition of existing OWTS for facility planning purposes and to locate 
 sources of water pollution and public health problems. </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">The sanitary survey must document high, areawide 
 failure rates that are considered serious enough to be a health hazard 
 (such as ground water contamination caused by malfunctioning OWTSs) in 
 order to document a need. The documentation must clearly state that OWTS 
 failures are contributing to a water pollution or health-related problem. 
 The fact that an area has soils unsuitable for OWTSs does not document 
 the need for sewers or a treatment plant. Communities with populations 
 of fewer than 10,000 persons are able to use a letter from a registered 
 state or county Sanitarian or Professional Engineer with documentation 
 or other evidence of a site visit that supports the determination of need. 
 EPA will review such documentation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

 Farm Plans and Conservation Plans are documents developed by NRCS (or 
 Conservation Districts) and farmers or landowner. They are a series of 
 actions developed to meet a farmer’s goals while protecting water quality 
 and the natural resources. Some of the things considered in a plan are 
 farm size, soils type, slope of the land, proximity to streams or water 
 bodies, type of livestock or crops, the farmer’s goals, resources such 
 as machinery or buildings and finances available. Farm Plans and Conservation 
 Plans recommend practices to improve farm productivity, reduce the impact 
 on the natural resources, and address potential water quality concerns. 
 </p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">Only those practices recommended to address 
 potential water quality problems should be included in the CWNS. Some 
 plans might include cost information. When using Conservation Plans or

 10,000 persons, use of a standard survey form developed by EPA is acceptable 
 for documenting need (and cost) as long as signatures are included. <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->If 
 costs are not included, cost curves can be used.</p>

<p style="font-size: 11pt;">For specific communities with populations of 
 3,500 or less and under extraordinary circumstances, states may apply 
 to EPA headquarters for pre-approval on ability for a state registered 
 engineer (PE) or circuit rider to sign the cost or need justification 
 for document type 71. States should send written statements to EPA headquarters 
 with the community’s details and why local signatures are not available. 
 Requests to EPA headquarters should be done individually for each community. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->States 
 should wait until EPA headquarters approves the request before entering 
 needs or cost information into the database.</p>
